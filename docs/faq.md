### Do I need a blockchain node to use Fiber Network?

No. You can connect to the API without needing a blockchain node.<br />
To do so, you can follow our [Getting started](./usage/getting-started.mdx) guide.

### Can I connect using Websockets?

Yes, you can use the JSON-RPC API over Websocket. You can find more information in the [JSON-RPC API](./usage/json-rpc.mdx) section. If you don't have strict requirements to use Websockets, we recommend using gRPC instead, as it's a little bit faster and more efficient.

### Which networks does Fiber support?

For now, only Ethereum. Support for other EVM chains (Polygon, BSC) is planned.
