## Sending Transactions

**Fiber's users can leverage [Echo](https://echo.chainbound.io/) a standalone product, developed by Chainbound, to easily broadcast transactions to block builders and validators.**

:::info
[Here](https://echo.chainbound.io/) Echo's official documentation!
:::

Echo has the following unique features:
- **UX & Convenience**: Unified API for quick bundle submissions.
- **Front-running Protection**: Direct transmissions to block builders, skipping the mempool to defend against MEV.
- **Maintenance & Upgrades**: Automated system upgrades and updates with the latest builder API specifications.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Immediate alerts once your bundle is included in a block via Fiber's `execution_payloads` stream.
- **Mempool Add-on Integration**:
    - Use the `SendTransactionSequence` method from Fiber.
    - Allows global dispatch to both mempools and builders.
    - _Ideal for rapid inclusion tasks like hack-prevention and Oracle updates._
