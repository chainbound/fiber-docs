On the consensus layer (eth2) network, we offer direct peering connections to our nodes. As a result,
your connected beacon node will receive blocks over the P2P connection as soon as our network sees them.
This can result in a significant latency decrease compared to the standard P2P network: anywhere from
500ms to 2 seconds. For more information about FiberGuard, check out [this section in the use cases](../use-cases#31-fiberguard).

## Requirements
:::note
We assume that you've signed up for the FiberGuard plan and we have your peer ID and ENR registered in our system.
To get this information about your node, you can query the following endpoint: `http://<beacon_node_api>/eth/v1/node/identity`.
:::

### Fiber Multiaddress

Once you've signed up for the plan, you will have received the [multiaddress](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/addressing/) of
one of our nodes based on your location. A multiaddress looks like this: `/ip4/151.150.191.80/tcp/9000/p2p/16Ui...aXRz`. This
multiaddress encodes the network information (IP address and TCP port), as well as the P2P peer ID (`16Ui...aXRz`).

### Static Peer ID
Ideally, you have configured your node with a static peer ID so we don't have to go through the process of registering
your information every time you restart your beacon node. Instructions on how to do that for the major consensus clients can
be found below:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="lighthouse" label="Lighthouse">

Enabled by default.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="prysm" label="Prysm">

Add the following CLI option to the startup command:
```
--p2p-static-id
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="teku" label="Teku">

Enabled by default.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nimbus" label="Nimbus">

Specify a file that contains a private key using the following option:
```
--netkey-file <path/to/file.json>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up
For ensuring the most reliable connection, your beacon node should add the Fiber peer as a static and trusted peer.
**Static** means the connection will always be retried on failure. **Trusted** means the peer is safe from any peer
scoring systems or pruning routines. Below we outline how to do this for the different consensus clients:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="lighthouse" label="Lighthouse">

Lighthouse requires 2 options to be set.
Static multiaddress:
```
--libp2p-addresses <MULTIADDR>
```
Trusted peer:
```
--trusted-peers <PEER_ID>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="prysm" label="Prysm">

With Prysm, you can add a trusted, static peer with the following flag:
```
--peer <MULTIADDR>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="teku" label="Teku">

Teku provides multiple ways to add a static, trusted peer: https://docs.teku.consensys.net/development/reference/cli#p2p-static-peers. 

The easiest way is to add the following CLI flag to the startup command:
```
--p2p-static-peers=<MULTIADDR>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nimbus" label="Nimbus">

With Nimbus, you can add a trusted, static peer with the following flag:
```
--direct-peer <MULTIADDR>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Checking the Connection
If everything went well, your beacon node should now be connected to our Fiber node. You can check the connection status
by querying the beacon API (usually on port 5052).

For example:
```bash
curl localhost:5052/eth/v1/node/peers/<PEER_ID>
```
where `<PEER_ID>` is the peer ID of the Fiber node.

The response should indicate a `connected` state like in the example response below:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "peer_id": "QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCrM2EmxFTANf8wXmmE7DWjhx5N",
    "enr": "enr:-IS4QHCYrYZbAKWCBRlAy5zzaDZXJBGkcnh4MHcBFZntXNFrdvJjX04jRzjzCBOonrkTfj499SZuOh8R33Ls8RRcy5wBgmlkgnY0gmlwhH8AAAGJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQPKY0yuDUmstAHYpMa2_oxVtw0RW_QAdpzBQA8yWM0xOIN1ZHCCdl8",
    "last_seen_p2p_address": "/ip4/7.7.7.7/tcp/4242/p2p/QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCrM2EmxFTANf8wXmmE7DWjhx5N",
    "state": "connected",
    "direction": "outbound"
  }
}
```
